This is currently a WIP of a mod I decided to create on a whim after seeing the impending port of ACE Fire from Arma 2 to Arma 3. The general idea was to take the screams of the port and make it even more silly by replacing them with iconic Scientist screams from Half-Life 1.

That's it! 15 screams were chosen to replace the ACE Screaming sounds. It's as simple as that.
